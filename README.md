# ELEC4622 - Multimedia Image Processing
## Project1
1. Reduce the image by the factor of 2/5 with windowed sinc filters
    * Direct filtering with 2D Kernels
    * separability as an important basis for minimizing the complexity
1. Expand the image by the factor of 5/2 with bi-linear interpolation
1. Reduce the image by the factor of 5/2 with windowed sinc filters
    * Direct filtering with 2D Kernels
    * separability as an important basis for minimizing the complexity
1. Compare two images in terms of MSE and PSNR and write out the difference
