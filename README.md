# ELEC4622 - Multimedia Image Processing
## Project1
1. **Reduce** the image by the factor of 2/5 with windowed sinc filters
    * Direct filtering with 2D Kernels
    * separability as an important basis for minimizing the complexity
1. **Expand** the image by the factor of 5/2 with bi-linear interpolation

1. Compare two images in terms of MSE and PSNR and write out the **difference image**

## Project2
1. Generate a bi-level image given with the **threshold** 
1. Morphological **erosion**
1. Morphological **erosion** with roughly circular structuring sets of various radius values r
1. Morphological **opening**
1. Morphological **closing**

## Project3
1. Global translational **motion estimator** that uses a fixed set of keypoints
1. **Motion compensated** using bilinear interpolation
1. **Keypoint detection** with the Harris corner detector
